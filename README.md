## Supabase Database Configuration

### Database Structure for Messaging Feature

To implement the chat functionality in the application, the following tables and functions need to be configured in Supabase:

#### Table Structure

1. **conversations** - Store conversations
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.conversations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

2. **conversation_participants** - Store conversation participants
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.conversation_participants (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    conversation_id UUID REFERENCES public.conversations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
    UNIQUE (conversation_id, user_id)
);
```

3. **messages** - Store messages
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.messages (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    conversation_id UUID REFERENCES public.conversations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    sender_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    read BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

#### Indexes and Stored Procedures

The application uses multiple indexes and stored procedures to optimize query performance for conversations and messages. For detailed configuration, please refer to the Supabase project settings.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
